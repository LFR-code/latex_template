@article{schutter2021the-blue-econom,
	abstract = {The blue economy has become an influential concept in international and national marine governance discourse. Various contested interpretations exist, and different actors choose to emphasise different aspects of the triple goal of environmental, economic, and social improvements. However, despite disagreement over its interpretations, the blue economy finds support in many different arenas. This paper explores the position of dominance that the blue economy has reached, and examines how supporters of the concept maintain and employ power to keep it relevant. The paper applies a mixed-methods approach: 29 semi-structured interviews with people in roles of formal decision-making across the fisheries sector, economic development and tourism sector, conservation and environment sector, and specific blue economy-institutions are supplemented by observations from the wider landscape during 4 months of fieldwork in Seychelles. Findings show that in international discourse, the blue economy obtains and maintains its influence through persuasion and through the construction of a `common sense' and productive way forward, capable of achieving triple wins. Within this narrative, oceans are undergoing a reconfiguration as economic frontiers, and the blue economy places economic growth from oceans centrally within contemporary environmental governance. Maintaining the blue economy as a powerful concept on the ground is done through social power relations: the blue economy functions as a boundary object, contributing to depoliticisation of discussions about a shared vision. Depoliticisation allows Seychelles to continue using the concept despite simmering dissent among policy makers, practitioners, and resource users. Dominance of the blue economy on the international stage means that associating with it brings Seychelles visibility and influence. The usefulness of the concept in eliding tensions makes it difficult for counter-hegemony to arise, although alternatives are emerging elsewhere, such as blue justice. However, fundamental change is needed to re-politicise environmental decision-making and explicitly discuss values and images attached to the blue economy.},

	abstract = {Rebuilding overfished stocks is central to fisheries policy, with the United States Magnuson-Stevens Act aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14.4 ``to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield.'' In mixed stock fisheries, very low allowable catches for rebuilding stocks can lead to an inability to harvest abundant stocks. There are consequently trade-offs between the yield obtained during rebuilding and the rate of rebuilding. We retrospectively evaluate rebuilding plans in the US West Coast groundfish fishery to identify alternative harvest strategies that could have minimized adverse impacts to stakeholders while still achieving stock rebuilding targets. We use current assessments of 13 groundfish stocks to project spawning biomass and catch under various harvest policies. We estimate that an additional $886 million USD in ex-vessel revenue could have been obtained had an FMSY strategy permitting slower rebuilding rates been adopted. We also examined what catch limits would have been under a FMSY strategy using the information available at the time rebuilding plans were implemented. These alternative catch limits would have provided much greater fishing opportunity while still rebuilding the stocks. Our findings support those of the National Research Council, which in 2014 reported that rebuilding plans based on fishing mortality rates may be preferable to those focused on meeting strict rebuilding timelines.},

@article{wang2016functional,
	abstract = { With the advance of modern technology, more and more data are being recorded continuously during a time interval or intermittently at several discrete time points. These are both examples of functional data, which has become a commonly encountered type of data. Functional data analysis (FDA) encompasses the statistical methodology for such data. Broadly interpreted, FDA deals with the analysis and theory of data that are in the form of functions. This paper provides an overview of FDA, starting with simple statistical notions such as mean and covariance functions, then covering some core techniques, the most popular of which is functional principal component analysis (FPCA). FPCA is an important dimension reduction tool, and in sparse data situations it can be used to impute functional data that are sparsely observed. Other dimension reduction approaches are also discussed. In addition, we review another core technique, functional linear regression, as well as clustering and classification of functional data. Beyond linear and single- or multiple- index methods, we touch upon a few nonlinear approaches that are promising for certain applications. They include additive and other nonlinear functional regression models and models that feature time warping, manifold learning, and empirical differential equations. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of future directions. },

@article{Carruthers2014Evaluating,
	abstract = {Abstract The majority of global fish stocks lack adequate data to evaluate stock status using conventional stock assessment methods. This poses a challenge for the sustainable management of these stocks. Recent requirements to set scientifically based catch limits in several countries, and growing consumer demand for sustainably managed fish have spurred an emerging field of methods for estimating overfishing thresholds and setting catch limits for stocks with limited data. Using a management strategy evaluation framework we quantified the performance of a number of data-limited methods. For most life-histories, we found that methods that made use of only historical catches often performed worse than maintaining current fishing levels. Only those methods that dynamically accounted for changes in abundance and/or depletion performed well at low stock sizes. Stock assessments that make use of historical catch and effort data did not necessarily out-perform simpler data-limited methods that made use of fewer data. There is a high value of additional information regarding stock depletion, historical fishing effort and current abundance when only catch data are available. We discuss the implications of our results for other data-limited methods and identify future research priorities. },

@article{Dowling2014Guidelines,
	abstract = {Abstract There has been extensive literature discussion regarding data-poor assessments, but considerably less on harvest strategies for data-poor fisheries. There is also a large body of work around harvest strategy development for data-rich fisheries. However, there has been little discussion or specific guidance regarding the process of developing and implementing formal harvest strategies for data-poor fisheries. We outline such a process, illustrated using case studies of data-poor Australian Commonwealth fisheries. The process comprises: (1) compile and review available information; (2) identify possibly indicators; (3) identify reference points for key indicators; (4) select an appropriate harvest strategy and decision rules; (5) if possible, formally evaluate whether the harvest strategy options are likely to achieve the management objectives; and (6) implementation. While this approach is similar to that for data-rich cases, there is less statistical or estimation detail within each step. Even with minimal capacity, the guidelines outlined here, backed by even the simplest form of management strategy evaluation, provide an approach that should enable harvest strategies to be proposed and associated monitoring to be implemented. Monitoring requirements may be explicitly built into harvest strategies via trigger reference points and control rules related to data-collection. While prior formal evaluation provides the best basis for testing the efficacy of a harvest strategy, there remains disparity between the corresponding required capacity and what many agencies and institutions worldwide are capable of providing. Thus, the extent to which harvest strategies may be effectively evaluated and implemented remains an unresolved challenge for data-poor fisheries, but one whose resolution is predicated, at least in the first instance, on adequate monitoring. },

@article{Dowling2014Empirical-harve,
	abstract = {Abstract Harvest strategy approaches based around empirical indicators and/or control rules are beginning to be accepted in a growing range of data- and capacity-poor fisheries. While there is an increasing body of work around developing empirical indicators and control rules in data-poor contexts, this has typically been done on a case-specific basis. There remains a need for general guidance on formulating control rules that link empirical indicators with suitable management responses. Additionally, in the data-poor context, most literature has focused on empirical indicators and assessments, with less focus on decision rules and the incorporation of indicators and assessments in a harvest strategy framework. This review considers a range of harvest strategy options, focusing on empirical indicators and decision rules available for data-poor species and fisheries. These clearly illustrate that a paucity of information is not a reason to avoid developing harvest strategies, and that a range of pragmatic approaches are available regardless of the available data, life-history of the target species, nature of fishing operations, or the available research capacity. There is considerable scope for further work in this field, but arguably there is a comprehensive repository of approaches and decision rules that, when combined with the guidelines, form a solid foundation and toolkit for all but the most data-poor species and fisheries. },

@article{Ono2015Think-outside-t,
	abstract = {Abstract A method is developed to objectively stratify a study area for standardizing catch per unit effort (CPUE) data for use in a generalized linear modeling framework. The method involves two steps: (1) subdividing the study area into small grids and applying a boosted regression tree method based on the full model to reconstruct a rough population pattern among grids and (2) applying a k-medoids algorithm to partition the grids into discrete strata based on the trend and magnitude of expected \{CPUE\} in each grid (time series clustering) or the spatial proximity and average \{CPUE\} in each grid (spatial clustering). The main advantage of this method compared to other area stratification approaches is that the shape of the resulting strata best matches the population structure as inferred from CPUE. This approach reduced bias in indices of abundance compared to ad-hoc methods. The variant of the area stratification method based on time series clustering performed best. However, this approach often performed as poorly as ad-hoc methods when there was a unidirectional shift in fishing locations over time because strata did not necessarily capture the shifts in fishing grounds over time. However, when the strata were selected to capture the shift in fishing grounds, both arbitrary and cluster-based method produced an index of abundance that was close to unbiased. Finally, the study showed that goodness of fit criteria (AICc or BIC) can be used to select the optimal number of strata for \{CPUE\} standardization, but this does not guarantee improved accuracy of the derived index of abundance compared to a pre-specified number of strata. The importance of conducting sensitivity analysis and the use of an ensemble approach is highlighted. },

@article{Langseth2010Parameter-estim,
	abstract = {Bayesian networks with mixtures of truncated exponentials (MTEs) support efficient inference algorithms and provide a flexible way of modeling hybrid domains (domains containing both discrete and continuous variables). On the other hand, estimating an \{MTE\} from data has turned out to be a difficult task, and most prevalent learning methods treat parameter estimation as a regression problem. The drawback of this approach is that by not directly attempting to find the parameter estimates that maximize the likelihood, there is no principled way of performing subsequent model selection using those parameter estimates. In this paper we describe an estimation method that directly aims at learning the parameters of an \{MTE\} potential following a maximum likelihood approach. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method yields significantly better likelihood results than existing regression-based methods. We also show how model selection, which in the case of univariate \{MTEs\} amounts to partitioning the domain and selecting the number of exponential terms, can be performed using the \{BIC\} score. },

	abstract = {Abstract Wildfires are critical for ecosystems in many geographical regions. However, our current urbanized existence in these environments is inducing the ecological balance to evolve into a different dynamic leading to the biggest fires in history. Wildfire wind speeds and directions change in an instant, and first responders can only be effective if they take action as quickly as the conditions change. What is lacking in disaster management today is a system integration of real-time sensor networks, satellite imagery, near-real time data management tools, wildfire simulation tools, and connectivity to emergency command centers before, during and after a wildfire. As a first time example of such an integrated system, the \{WIFIRE\} project is building an end-to-end cyberinfrastructure for real-time and data-driven simulation, prediction and visualization of wildfire behavior. This paper summarizes the approach and early results of the \{WIFIRE\} project to integrate networked observations, e.g., heterogeneous satellite data and real-time remote sensor data with computational techniques in signal processing, visualization, modeling and data assimilation to provide a scalable, technological, and educational solution to monitor weather patterns to predict a wildfire's Rate of Spread. },

First, a RF is used to find the most important predictors for a given response, then a decision tree analysis is used to choose break-points for the discretisation of a continuous variable.

The decision tree analysis used to discretise the variables removes subjectivity - or the misguided convenience of equal length intervals -  from the discretisation process. It uses a recursive binary partitioning technique, but this doesn't restrict us to a 2-level factor after discretisation.

This could be very useful for our application. Can we automate this?},

@article{jannot2013identifying,
	annote = {This paper outlines a method of classifying the leading cause of bycatch of a given species as social (fisher behaviour) or ecological. This is done by comparing fishery dependent (commercial) and fishery independent (survey) data on bycatch/discard weights and many other covariates, including space and time.

Data are fit to a "delta/hurdle" model, which appears to be a zero-inflated regression model of absolute bycatch weight. Zero inflation comes from a binmial logit model for presence/absence of bycatch, and then non-zero catch is assumed to have log-normal residuals to the regression line. The methods are unclear on the specific structure of the model.

** Their bias correction seems backwards in the manuscript, check on this **

A very interesting addition is the inclusion of a lag effect, where a covariate which indicates recent bycatch is included.

I think it would be valuable to try to follow a similar method for juvenile sablefish, comparing survey to commercial catch data - perhaps fitting to CPUE data instead of absolute catch. We could improve upon their method, as we have 100% ASOP data which can control for any kind of observer effect or selection bias they might have encountered. It would also add some weight to the "can we predict bycatch" question.},

This can be achieved through methodical allocation of the rights pertaining to fisheries and simultaneous implementation of policy instruments to correct for market failures and equity concerns. We emphasize via a roadmap that there are some general principles that should be invoked when choosing between alternative structures of rights. Our examples from Sweden provide evidence of the flexibility of fishing rights and how they can be adapted to integrate fixes from different disciplines into practical fisheries management. },

@article{Miller2010Climate-change-,
	abstract = {This paper explores the importance of a focus on the fundamental goals of resilience and adaptive capacity in the governance of uncertain fishery systems, particularly in the context of climate change. Climate change interacts strongly with fishery systems, and adds to the inherent uncertainty in those complex, interlinked systems. The reality of these uncertainties and linkages leads to a recognition of the need for robust and adaptive management approaches in order to enhance system resilience. To this end, the paper proposes a focus on stronger moves to {\^a}€˜integrative science{\^a}€{\texttrademark} methods and processes {\^a}€`` to support suitable institutional responses, a broader planning perspective, and development of suitable resilience-building strategies. The paper explores how synergies between institutional change and integrative science can facilitate the development of more effective fisheries policy approaches. Specifically, integrative science can provide a vehicle (1) to examine policy options with respect to their robustness to uncertainty, particularly to climate-related regime shifts and (2) to allow better assessments of behavioral responses of fish, humans and institutions. The argument is made that understanding these aspects of fishery systems and fishery governance is valuable even in the absence of climate-induced processes of change, but that attention to climate change both reinforces the need for, and facilitates the move toward, implementation of integrative science for improved fishery governance. },

The economic analysis is shown to be far more pessimistic with regards to the potential of marine reserves as a fisheries management tool, than what one finds in the purely ecological analysis, the reason being the latter's neglect of issues such as discounting and economic incentive behaviour. However, economic analysis, despite some of it being relatively advanced with regards to spatiality, is still simplistic with regards to for instance ecosystem and habitat content. A simple expansion of the existing bioeconomic models with regards to positive habitat effects of area closures is presented and analysed, showing room for improved results from marine reserve implementation as compared to the existing analysis. },

@article{Smith2003183,
	abstract = {Marine biologists have shown virtually unqualified support for managing fisheries with marine reserves, signifying a new resource management paradigm that recognizes the importance of spatial processes in exploited systems. Most modeling of reserves employs simplifying assumptions about the behavior of fishermen in response to spatial closures. We show that a realistic depiction of fishermen behavior dramatically alters the conclusions about reserves. We develop, estimate, and calibrate an integrated bioeconomic model of the sea urchin fishery in northern California and use it to simulate reserve policies. Our behavioral model shows how economic incentives determine both participation and location choices of fishermen. We compare simulations with behavioral response to biological modeling that presumes that effort is spatially uniform and unresponsive to economic incentives. We demonstrate that optimistic conclusions about reserves may be an artifact of simplifying assumptions that ignore economic behavior. },

@article{Pelc201556,
	abstract = {Abstract This paper examines the sustainability of United States fisheries managed under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the law that provides the framework for federal fisheries management. Sustainability across a broad suite of criteria, including health of the fished stock, bycatch, and effects on the habitat and ecosystem, was measured against the Monterey Bay Aquarium×³s Seafood Watch criteria for ecological sustainability. Seafood Watch ratings and numerical scores for U.S. federally managed fisheries were analyzed to elucidate strengths and weaknesses among federally-managed fisheries. Of U.S. federally managed fisheries assessed by Seafood Watch, only 2% are rated {\^a}€{\oe}Avoid{\^a}€, and strong ratings for stock health for nearly all fisheries indicate that the Magnuson-Stevens Act is fundamentally succeeding at maintaining or rebuilding the abundance of targeted stocks. The majority (79%) of U.S. fisheries earn the intermediate rating of {\^a}€{\oe}Good Alternative{\^a}€, and 19% earn the top rating of {\^a}€{\oe}Best Choice{\^a}€. Given that U.S. fisheries management is considered among the strongest in the world, this analysis assesses why the majority of U.S. fisheries are not rated {\^a}€{\oe}Best Choice{\^a}€. Fisheries for all variety of species, and using a wide range of fishing methods, can merit {\^a}€{\oe}Best Choice{\^a}€ status. However, the majority of U.S. fisheries do not achieve this rating due primarily to bycatch concerns. By improving performance with regard to bycatch, most {\^a}€{\oe}Good Alternative{\^a}€ U.S. federal fisheries could reach {\^a}€{\oe}Best Choice{\^a}€ status and reap rewards in the marketplace for that recognition. Findings suggest that current science-based management should be maintained in the Magnuson-Stevens Act reauthorization, managers should adopt best practices based on fisheries that are already performing well in the U.S., and more specific federal bycatch mitigation requirements should be implemented. },
	annote = {With the looming re-authorisation of the Magnuson-Stevens Act (MSA) in the USA, Pelc et al examine the effectiveness of the Act through the lens of the Monterey Bay Aquarium SeaFood Watch (SFW) sustainability criteria. They find that while the Act is working as intended in most areas, there 79% of landings are failing to achieve a "Best Choice" grade form SFW.

An analysis of the US fisheries which are rated as "Good Alternative" - the second grade in the SFW rating system - shows that the quality holding back the most fisheries is the level of bycatch intercepted. Indeed, on average "Good Alternative" fisheries receive the lowest grade on impact of non-target species.

The authors conclude that improving the performance of US fisheries with regard to bycatch would most quickly improve their sustainability ratings. They give the examples of the Alaska and West Coast rockfish trawl fisheries with 100% ASOP, robust stock assessments and srict quotas as examples of successfully reducing bycatch and improving sustainability. Finally, they conclude with a recommendation of no weakening of the MSA, which would run counter to the spirit of the original Act.

	abstract = {Many fisheries around the world are plagued with the problem of bycatch{\^a}€''the inadvertent harvesting and discard of non-targeted species. Bycatch occurs when targeted and non-targeted species coincide in the same habitat and gear is imperfectly selective. One of the prevailing methods of controlling bycatch is the common-pool quota system. Under this system, biologists set total allowable catches (TACs) for both the targeted and non-targeted species, and the fishing season is closed when one of these \{TACs\} binds. We develop a predictive model of a renewable resource that is regulated with this kind of common-pool quota system. The model demonstrates that the equilibrium will generally be characterized by excessive discards, shortened seasons, and foregone target species harvest. These results occur even with very efficient (low bycatch) fishing gear. We examine the sensitivity of our predictions to changes in technological parameters and degrees of spatial correlation of target and non-target species. Finally, we derive the optimal bycatch penalty function and describe its significance in light of various policy options available to regulators. },

	abstract = {Individual-based modelling is a reductionistic technique for describing ecological systems. In contrast to more traditional mathematical models, an individual-based model is not described {\^a}€˜top-down{\^a}€{\texttrademark}, like a black box, but {\^a}€˜bottom-up{\^a}€{\texttrademark} by the structure and dynamics of the discrete entities of the system considered important for the issue under study. The majority of individual-based models are hand-coded software programs, designed and implemented by ecologists. In truth individual-based models are currently synonymous with their implementation on computer{\^a}€''for generally speaking no complete description of a model other than the executable program itself is available. This leads to a number of fundamental and technical problems, which may partly be overcome by the use of appropriate software tools. But although software tools are available for simulation studies in many other fields of application, the number of tools which assist individual-based modelling and simulation is limited. In this paper we examine different strategies for the software support of individual-based modelling. We identify three different layers of software support. Firstly, we discuss software frameworks being implemented on top of general purpose programming languages. Although software frameworks support the programming of any individual-based model, they can only be used by an ecologist able to develop computer programs. Secondly, we look at interactive modelling tools being used by ecologists who build models for specific fields of application. Thirdly, we investigate simulators which support users who do not want to build their own model but would rather use a predefined existing model. For each of these categories we briefly describe a tool that has been or is currently being developed at the \{OFFIS\} institute. Attention is mainly focused on the conception of a modelling tool (wesp-tool) designed to support the modelling and analysis of individual-based metapopulation models. },

@inproceedings{preisler2001stochastic,
	annote = {The article is a review of the authors' work on modeling animal movement using stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The paper focuses on two examples: the movements of bark beetles attracted by a pheromone source, and the movement of elk and deer around a home range. The article focuses on parameter estimation from data and provides a brief description of parameter estimation techniques.

The SDEs are decomposed into a deterministic part and a stochastic part which is usually a random walk (Wiener/Levy process). In essence, SDEs can be thought of as the sum of an ODE or PDE with a random process. A general form of an SDE is given, though it is not made clear what stochastic calculus is used - I don't yet know if this is important or not.

The most interesting to my research presently is the use of a potential function based on location in the Elk model, given most generally as the gradient vector. This is directly applicable to my Sablefish movement model using only bathymetry as a proxy for habitat preference.

In conclusion, I think this will be a good starting point for developing a cognitive framework within which I can produce a simulator based on SDEs. Next stop, numerical solvers!

Branch and co-authors investigate the efficacy of ITQs for managing discards in multispecies fisheries. They compare two study systems, the BC GTF and the US West Coast groundfish fishery, by investigating discard fractions of all species which occur in both fisheries. The discard fraction of a species is defined as the ratio of discards to catch, and the marketable discard fraction as the ratio of marketable discards to catch.

The US West Coast groundfish is regulated by 2-monthly cumulative landing limits, introduced to replace trip limits which were originally intended to reduce discarding. With highly overfished species - of which there are many - and species they co-occur with the limits are highly restrictive to encourage avoidance of that species as targeted catch and bycatch. This has led to a reduction of total mortality of overfished species, however discard fractions have increased.

The BC GTF introduced a 100% ASOP in 1996 after a brief closure of the fishery in 1995. Discarding of marketable fish is and was allowed, but any discarded marketable fish (defined as above size limits) were counted against quota after a mortality rate based on trawl duration and species is applied. A fully ITQ system was introduced in 1997, including discard mortality of marketable fish and allowing annual catch limits to be bought and sold. Quota holders are allowed to carry underages and overages of up to 37.5% forward into the following year.

The study found that discard fractions were higher in the USWC fishery than in the BCGTF  for all species and groups in 2001-2002 and most in 2002-2003. The drop in USWC in 02/03 is likely explained by the introduction of groundfish conservation areas. This means greater discards in the west coast fishery. They authors provide a few different reasons, including regulatory structure and priorities, market acceptance and fleet technology and size, among others. Discard fractions are orders of magnitude lower for some species in the BC fleet compared to the USWC fleet, and marketable discard fractions an order of magnitude lower again.

They conclude that the key to BC's success in reducing discards by so much is the combination of the ITQ system for all caught fish, not just landings, and the 100% ASOP coverage. Without observers, limits can only be placed on landings, and restricted landings only incentivises high-grading.},

@article{gillis1995dynamic,
	annote = {Gillis et al. use foraging theory applied to a fishing vessel to simulate high-grading behaviour in an Oregon trawl fishery. Each trawl vessel is considered as a predator where the crew make decisions to maximise benefits, in this case landed value. Predictions are consistent with observations of the fleet.

Mixed species trawlers can be considered as predators with multiple prey of differing nutritional value (price). Hold capacity and quota regulations are analogous to gut capacity, and discarding is analogous to partial prey consumption. Opportunity costs associated with handling time are eliminated as processing can occur while the next trawl is deployed.

Simulation is done using stochastic dynamic programming to generate optimality rules. Parameters were fit to the available data, however some were varied to produce different simulator runs for sensitivity and actor behaviour analysis. The results were consistent with observations within the fleet, and unsurprising as far as behaviour goes, suggesting the model is valid.

The value of this will be as a method to build a model for the implications of bycatch predictability based on previous data, simulating set-back and move on rules or avoidance. There will be a challenge in validation, but we can get to that later. We can then set the model to maximise landed value under different rule structures and generate outcomes based on simulated fishing, where discarding is avoided.},

@article{mcgarvey2002estimating,
	annote = {The authors provide a family of models which rely only on tag recovery data in order to estimate movement probabilities between spatial cells. Their model extends the models of Hilborn (1990) and Schwarz (1993), modified to allow for arbitrary release dates (typical in a fishery) and to only provide movement parameters. They provide four models with different requirements of data external to movement (such as catch and effort, age structure etc) in an appendix.

The key advantage of their model is the independence from reporting rate estimates in each spatial cell - an historic source of bias in these models. They make the assumption that this is uniform across each spatial cell, and as a consequence the term is cancelled in the mathematical formulation of the model likelihood. Indeed, they show that any other survival or process rate that can be assumed as spatially uniform will also cancel, including:

	- short term tag mortality
	- ongoing tag mortality
	- tag loss
	- natural mortality.

They make some assumptions and idealisations about temporal parameters in order to make their model work without too much fiddling.

First, they assume that the fish move at one time each year, at the beginning of January, chosen as the middle of the highest season of directed movement (Summer in Australia). This was because they sought to represent long-term directed migration.

Second, they choose months as their discrete time step. This they admit as arbitrary during discussion and provide a method for modifying the model to a day long step - more applicable to tagging data where a date of release and recovery is usually given.

Third, as mentioned previously, they assume that reporting rates are uniform across spatial cells, leading to a cancellation of the terms in the likelihood.

Finally, they assume that mortality rates (fishing and natural) are known or estimated in three of their four presented models, a possible source of bias.

It would be good to see this model applied to other data, and a simulation/estimation procedure, with a shorter time step and subjecting several of the assumptions to sensitivity analyses. Also, it seems like they missed an opportunity for providing a Bayesian analysis of the model - something for us to consider.},

@article{getz2008framework,
	annote = {Getz and Saltz (getz me some saltz) describe a mathematically detailed framework providing an exposition of the conceptual mode of Nathan et al (2008), which can be used for both simulation and estimation (state-space) procedures. 

Their model is built around the notions of fundamental movement elements (FMEs), such as lunges versus steps taken at a normal pace, and canonical activity modes (CAMs), composites of FMEs that emerge from the activity in question. FMEs require a very high sampling rate of time to capture in recording devices, and therefore they are quite unrealistic to simulate. 

In 2008, CAMs are the preferred place to start developing a framework for movement analysis. The advantage of using CAMs over FMEs is that the time sampling resolution required to record FMEs is often impossible to achieve in practice. While a single CAM is unlikely to account for all of an individual's time, a reasonable tradeoff might exist in defining several to account for most of an individual's time.

The authors provide a brief review of random walks and diffusion, with references which should definitely fall onto this author's reading list (references 1 - 20).

The most valuable material for us right now is the explicit description of the {"movement paths on structured landscapes"} framework, allowing for a development of movement modes (CAMs) from a set of defined FMEs for each individual in a system and how to model this with a varying landscape of topography and resources. The framework they expose will be very useful in refining the IBM for sablefish movement.

The authors extend the framework with habitat preference based on food and safety near the end of the article. They also include fission-fusion dynamics for social ungulates - something that might have applications to schooling fish.},

@article{fryxell2008multiple,
	annote = {This paper studies movement of elk which were reintroduced in southern ontario. The main goal of the paper is to test the hypothesis that animals switch between movement phases as a complex function of internal state, habitat preference, and motion and navigational capacity. The hypothesis is tested at several spatio-temporal scales, ranging from minutes and metres to years and hundreds of kilometers, and differing phases were found to exist at three different scales.

All individuals in the introduced group of elk were equipped with VHF radio transmitters. Coarse resolution (~1km sampling error) movement patterns were evalutated using telemetry collected by vehicles and fixed wing aircraft. Intermediate scale (~10 - 100m sampling error) movements were evaluated based on GPS satellite telemetry. Fine scale movements were studied by using elk tracks left in the snow, with a sampling error of <1m.

At all three levels, biphasic movement was detected. At the coarse scale, introduced herds switched from dispersion patterns to home-range (locally bounded) behaviour in 1-3 years after release. At the internmediate scale, movement was more like Levy walk patterns, with several days spent grazing in a small (<1ha) area before suddenly relocating several km. When encamped, reversals (grazing movement - highly variable turning angles) was more common, whereas when exploring, more linear movement was favoured (concentrated turning angle distribution).

At the intermediate level, the influence of social structure was included and the authors directly estimate causal factors of associated with group fragmentation and fusion. They find that individuals are strongly attracted to nearby groups and rarely leave once the groups are formed.

At fine scales, again two phases were found: foraging and non-foraging modes; turn angle distributions and step length distributions were signifcantly different between modes. There was obvious evidence that these were strongly influenced by food availability - habitat preference.

I think the most useful things we can take from this paper are the existence of multi-phasic movement modes for animals and the influence of social structure on movement. These can form the basis of an argument for increasing the spatio-temporal resolution of tagging data for marine species, considering current methods don't account for any multi-phasic movements.},

@article{righton2008reconstructing,
	annote = {This paper presents a method for esimating the movement patterns of demersal fish from data-logger tags in the north sea, called the DS (data-matching, simulation) method. It does so in two major steps. 

First, by combining information on depth and temperature from a data logger with an oceanographic simulation model to generate a list of plausible locations at each time step of the data, under the assumption that a fish can swim 0.5 body lengths in 1s.

Second, by generating likely pathways from release to recapture site using the oceanographic simulation model, plausible locations (nodes) are assigned a score, producing a likelihood surface. Then three metrics are used to choose a path: highest total score (max likelihood), highest average node score, or highest number of nodes.

The method was tested in simulation and by attaching a data-logger to fishing gear. In simulation, each method had varying performance, in some cases depending on the lateral spread available to it (narrower area, less variance, don't really need a data logger for that). 

Their simulation-estimation had average errors (deviation from actual path) ranging from 15.14km to 76.33km. The lowest error was for the direction with little lateral spread available for the fish to stray.

One thing that jumpe out at me is that there wasn't much of a reference to the error inherent in the oceanographic model: is this so easily modeled that we don't have any doubts? However, I see the value in keeping this `deterministic' insofar as providing a benchmark, as simulation isn't about prediction, after all, but about ranking options. Read Young (2002) in the references to find out more.

In their conclusion, they find that the DS method has differing levels of variability in different situations. It performs better in seasons with high temperature dynamism, where the crossing of thermal isoclines helps to reduce the number of plausible locations at certain time steps. Generous error thresholds for data-logging also resulted in higher numbers of matching locations at each time step.

Their results are in line with observations on the Dutch beam trawl fishery, on which the model was parameterised.

It is unclear what the value of this is to me, beyond giving some other DSV models to point to, and an exposition to emulate. A second reading while in the depths of building a DSV model will probably uncover some more useful chunks.

@article{winker2013comparison,
	annote = {Winker et al provide an alternative method of standardising commercial (fishery dependent) CPUE for use as an index of abundance in a multispecies fishery. The method is called the Direct Principal Component (DPC) methdo, which is a slight modification of the CFT (cluster fishing tactics) method commonly used to remove targeting effects from commercial data. Both CFT and DPC are compared on the same data sets. They suggest extending the method to other multispecies fisheries with different gear types, including trawl and longline.

Technical details: 

A GAM with covariates for time, space and species composition. In CFT the species composition is represented by a cluster ID formed from a PCA of the species composition matrix, while in DPC the first four PCs are used directly and replace the cluster ID. In general, a sensitivity analysis or some theoretical argument would be used to decide on the number of PCs needed.

Seems like it could be very valuable for increasing frequency of stock assessments here in BC, especially for those stocks which remain unassessed.},

@techreport{Stewart2014Accounting-for-,
	abstract = {The International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC or Commission) has the responsibility for conservation and yield from the Pacific halibut resource. In 2014, the Commission requested that the staff prepare a discussion paper on the biological and management issues involved with managing the removals of all sizes of Pacific halibut, particularly the explicit accounting for mortality of halibut less than 26 inches in length (U26). This report develops a conceptual extension to the current harvest policy which allows for direct evaluation of U26 mortality, and uses the 2013 results to compare harvest policy calculations with alternative distributions of removals among bycatch and the directed fishery.
Current harvest policy calculations do not respond to changes in projected annual U26 bycatch mortality; however, changes in bycatch removals (including both the O26 and U26 mortality) are found to have an approximate pound-for-pound effect on directed fishery yields when all other sources of mortality are considered. These effects are quantified and included in projection tables that summarize all sources and sizes of halibut mortality. This report outlines relevant management considerations, procedural constraints, and promising paths for future IPHC processes. Major sources of uncertainty relating to various components of these analyses are discussed, and potential data improvements that could reduce this uncertainty are also identified.},

Depth distributions are size-specific because fish migrate ontogenetically to deep water: With ontogenetic migration, fishery selectivities of commercial bottom trawls depend on depth of fishing because large fish ale most common in deep water. Depth distributions were similar for northern and southern areas and for males and females. Results show ontogenetic migration in sablefish, suggest a possible weak ontogenetic migration in longspine thornyhead, and confirm ontogenetic migration patterns already reported for Dover sole and shortspine thornyhead. Fishery selectivities varied among species, between areas, and changed dramatically over time for most species as fishing effort moved into deep water: Our approach used biological data collected during research bottom trawl surveys but was generally not affected by size selectivity of bottom trawl survey gear. Uncertainty in our commercial bottom trawl selectivity estimates was mostly from length-specific capture probabilities (or vulnerabilities) for fish in the path of commercial bottom trawls. Our estimates complement selectivity estimates fi om stock assessment models. The approach may be useful whenever the geographic distribution of fish depends on size ol age, fishing effort is not randomly distributed geographically, and sun ey estimates of fish density, bathymetric data, and commercial fishing effort information ar e available.},
